# Real-time-IoT-Sensor-Anomaly-Detection-using-Kafka-Streams-on-GKE-A-Cloud-Native-Implementation
A high-performance, cloud-native solution for real-time anomaly detection in IoT sensor networks using Apache Kafka on GKE. This project demonstrates advanced streaming data processing by implementing two distinct approaches: a traditional line-by-line method and an optimized KSQL stream processing solution,achieving a 25x performance improvement.
